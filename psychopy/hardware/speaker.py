class SpeakerDevice(BaseDevice):
    """Class for managing a physical speaker device for audio playback.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : int, optional
        Numeric index for the physical speaker device, according to psychtoolbox. Leave as None to 
        find the speaker by name.
    name : str, optional
        String name for the physical speaker device, according to your operating system. Leave as 
        None to find the speaker by numeric index.
    resampling : str, optional
        One of:
        - "play": Let your operating system handle resampling on playback. Not recommended for low 
        latency playback.
        - "load": Let PsychoPy resample audio clips when they're loaded. This allows low latency on 
        playback, but can mean slower loading with large files. This is the default mode.
        - "none": Do not resample audio clips. This is the safest option for low latency and fast 
        loading but means you'll get errors playing audio clips with a different sample rate to the 
        speaker / to previously played audio clips. Approach with caution.
    exclusive : bool, optional
        Should PsychoPy take exclusive control of the speaker, denying other applications access 
        when in use? In most cases the answer is no, but if resampling is "none" then taking 
        exclusive control allows you to play audio clips of a different sample rate to the speaker 
        without having to resample them (provided they are the same sample rate as one another).

        Attributes

            A numeric index referring to the device. This may differ from the value of `index` this 
            object was initialised with, as this will be the numeric index of the actual physical 
            speaker best matching what was requested.

            A string name referring to the device. This may differ from the value of `name` this 
            object was initialised with, as this will be the system-reported name of the actual
