What users say
=========================================

.. card-carousel:: 2

    .. card:: **Davide Massida** via twitter

        "PsychoPy is one of those things that improve the life of an experimental psychologist. Really. #python #neuroscience"

    .. card:: **Harriet Allen** Professor, University of Nottingham

        "What made me switch was the combination of Builder and Coder options. Students are not scared of the Builder, but I can still write code when needed (and even hide it in student experiments)."

    .. card:: **Nate Vack** Research Programmer, UW-Madison

        "It's wonderful to have a product that makes stimulus presentation easy (and is free!)..."

    .. card:: **Fenja Ziegler** Senior Lecturer, University of Lincoln

        "...easy to customise with a bit of scripting, a helpful user community, can be explained to a student in an hour or so..."

    .. card:: **Micah Allen** Post-doc, UCL

        "I love psychopy! I used it for one previous fMRI experiment and found the language extremely easy to use..."

How is PsychoPy Free?
=========================================

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2
    :gutter: 1

    .. grid-item::

        The PsychoPy desktop application is `free to download <https://www.psychopy.org/download.html>`_ and run for in-lab studies. PsychoPy® was written `by scientists <https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/graphs/contributors>`_ for scientists, the code underlying the software is open source on `GitHub <https://github.com/psychopy>`_, so even if you want to change the software you can!

        As PsychoPy grew in popularity, it became clear that developing it "as a side project" in researchers spare time was not going to be sustainable. We now have a company, `Open Science Tools <https://opensciencetools.org/>`_, to sustain professional development. We have three main sources of revenue:

        * `Pavlovia.org <https://pavlovia.org/>`_ licenses: A platform for hosting your study online if you want to collect data via a URL link.
        * `Consultancy <https://psychopy.org/consultancy.html>`_: Yes, you can pay us to make your task for you!
        * `Workshops <https://workshops.psychopy.org/>`_: We can run custom training workshops for your department/team.

        So, if you enjoy PsychoPy and would like to support its maintenance, please consider supporting us through one of these revenue streams. We try to keep our rates low-cost and affordable, whilst generating enough revenue to have a team of staff professionally develop PsychoPy and support users.

    .. grid-item::

        * Flexible and intuitive `Builder <https://www.psychopy.org/builder/>`_ interface to create huge range of studies
        * `Textbook(s) <https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/building-experiments-in-psychopy/book253480>`_ suitable for both undergraduate and professional audiences
        * Many further `resources <resources/resources.html>`_ for learning and teaching, including `Youtube tutorials <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFB5A1BE51964D587>`_, online tutorials and workshops.
        * The `Pavlovia repository <https://pavlovia.org>`_ of shared experiments accessible directly from the application (requires PsychoPy®) to search for and share your studies.

Precise enough for psychophysics
=========================================

Hardware accelerated graphics, best-in class timing, and calibration tools built-in

    .. grid-item::

        * Fantastic timing precision (see the `timing mega-study <https://peerj.com/articles/9414/>`_ for comparisons)!
        * Time and update your stimulus on every screen refresh!
        * Tools to help monitor calibration and wide range of units
        * Hardware-accelerated graphics for stimuli that can be updated on the fly
        * Access to button boxes when you need the utmost precision
        * Automated logging for you to what happened and when
        * OpenGL (and shaders) ready for use when you low-level access to graphics

        * *Dynamic, interactive studies:* Free yourself from simple static stimuli! You can update your stimulus interactively on every screen refresh!
        * *Neuroimaging:* Send and receive triggers to your hardware at precise times
        * *Eye-tracking:* Access to wide range of hardware (eye trackers, button boxes, trigger systems...)

Online
=========================================

Want to run your study on the web, so participants can access it anywhere?

Did you know PsychoPy® has a JavaScript sister library? `PsychoJS <https://github.com/psychopy/psychojs>`_, this means you can create a version of your experiment to run in a browser, after that you can use `Pavlovia.org <https://pavlovia.org>`_ to host it!

Pavlovia is:

    .. grid-item::

        * A secure server to host your experiment online.
        * An Open Access `library <https://pavlovia.org/explore/demos?sort=DEFAULT>`_ of experiment demos.
        * A place to create feature rich surveys using `Pavlovia Surveys <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fs8CVKBPGk>`_
        * Upload that to `Pavlovia.org <https://pavlovia.org>`_ (with easy tools built into the PsychoPy app)
        * Give participants your URL and run your study in the browser!
        * You can recruit participants using Sona, Prolific, Mechanical Turk or similar systems.
